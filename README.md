# Introduction
This project a Unity Project that will be used to showcase UI design capabilities and HDRP and VFX graph capabilities. This application simply allows user to select a scene, which will get you to listen to music and also enjoy the environmental design of each level.

# Development
This application is developed using Unity, C# and HDRP and URP Package. I spent around a month to develop this project during the last month of the work term to explore new capabilities of Unity Assets. Also, it is a good opportunity to apply new knowledges about Loading Screen for this project as well.

# Challenges
There is one major challenge which is adapting to a new system of HDRP and control the lighting of the scenery. Also, VFX graph is still a new area to explore for me and I will ad more scenes where VFX graph will be used more to get more practices.
